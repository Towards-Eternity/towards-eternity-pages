          <b>Where Did This Journey Reaching Millions Begin?</b><br /><br />Year
          2010... A few university students came together for a purpose. They
          wanted to do something for the young people of the ummah who were
          melting and hurting in the face of sins. They shared their concerns...
          They shared their concerns... They shared their concerns... There had
          to be a way to touch the hearts of millions. To make their voices
          heard...<br /><br /><b
            >Finding a Way to Spread the Word of Allah Everywhere</b
          >
          There had to be a way for the prayers of mothers to be answered for
          their children. Their troubles gave strength to their prayers. A
          journey that began with a small camera and microphone became a YouTube
          channel with 3 million subscribers.<br /><br /><b
            >A Small Camera and Recording!</b
          ><br /><br />With sincere, sympathetic, and sometimes impressive
          speeches in the language of young people, thousands of lives have
          changed. Some were led to prayer... Some were led to wearing the
          hijab... Some were led to abandon unlawful deeds. Through an internet
          cable, Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) were introduced
          into millions of homes.
